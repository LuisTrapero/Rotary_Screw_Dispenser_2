# Rotary Screw Dispenser 2
New version of the original Rotary Screw Dispenser (still looking for a better name).

## What is the Rotary Screw Dispenser?
The idea behind this project is to create a machine capable of separating a certain amount of nuts or count a large amount of them in a simple and affordable way, so anyone can automate processes like the packaging of DIY kits.

The principles of this project are:
* <b>Modular system:</b> this way you can automate a whole line of packaging using different automated dispenser machines.
* <b>Open Source:</b> anyone can download, modify and learn from this project. I will only use free and open source software to create anything related with this project. Right now i'm using FreeCad and the Arduino IDE and I plan to use KiCad and GIMP in the next stages of the development. I make this to support the open source tools and to give everyone who wants to follow this project the ease of reading or modifying any file with free and open programs. 
* <b>Easy to use and affordable:</b> so anyone can benefit from it.

## How does it work?
This machine uses the rotation of a servo motor and a simple system of matching holes to separate the nuts one by one so a sensor can detect them when they are traveling throw the tunnel

The structure of the machine consist of three parts: (WIP)
